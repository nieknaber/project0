This website consists of 3 main pages which can be accessed by the navigation bar. This navigation bar is a component of bootstrap, which consists of an unordered list. If clicked on one on the navigation items, the browser will bring you to the corresponding html page. If hovered over on of the navigation items in the navigation bar, that item will get another color. The item of the page that you are on already has a different color to indicate which page is active.

The index, just as all pages, uses bootstraps grid model. There are 4 images present on the index page which are placed next to each other on a big screen, two by two on a middle screen, and all just listed below each other on a small screen. All images link to the recipe of the dish on the recipes page. It does so by referring to the recipies.html plus the id of the recipe it needs to go to. The header of this page is also responsive. It says: "welcome to my food page" if the screen is large enough, but when the screen is not large enough the header just says: "food page".

The recipes page has 4 rows with each 2 columns. The left column is aligned to the left, the right column is aligned to the right. If the screen gets smaller, those columns become separate rows and the alignment will become centered. Each row has an image of a dish, plus a table of its ingredients.

The contact page has 2 columns, which again become separate rows if the screen gets smaller. The page has two text boxes which can be filled in. After that you can press send and you will be brought to another page (message.html), consisting of an alert sating that your message hasn't actually been send because the email servers aren't responsive yet. On that page there is a button that can bring you back to the content page.
